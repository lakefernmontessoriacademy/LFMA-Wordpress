Brings Khan Academy exercises into your WordPress blogs. 

== Description ==

This Khan Exercises for WordPress plugin lets you host Khan Academy exercises in your WordPress blog. [Khan Exercises](http://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard) make learning complex subjects fun and they are free to everyone! However, the framework is very complex; it's difficult to embed its exercises into another web site. We made <a href='https://github.com/psimakov/khan-exercises'>framework changes</a>, which make it easier to embed the exercises and collect the exercise results right in your WordPress blog.

== Installation ==

Installation is very simple:

1. Download plugin zip file, and unzip it.
2. Upload `khan-exercises.php` and all other files to the `/wp-content/plugins/khan-exercises/` directory.
3. Activate the `Khan Exercises` plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
4. Login as Admin and go to `Settings` > `Khan Exercises`.
5. Review the plugin settings page and navigate the links to see the exercises.
